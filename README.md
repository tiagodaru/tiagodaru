- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tiagodaru
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in HomeLab & self hosting
- ğŸŒ± I'm learning about Proxmox and creating and virtualizing some servers and some applications and services running in docker.
I'm in Brazil and around here self hosting and homelab are difficulties, because providers block ports like 80, 443, 21, 22, among others.
And for this reason I am creating an Infrastructure that costs as little as possible.
- âœ¨ Collaboration on this project is welcome and I will share here what I have studied and used to help the community ...

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ This command is used to generate an encrypted username and password to put in the docker-compose.yml

ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Este comando serve para gerar um usuÃ¡rio e senha criptografados para colocar no docker-compose.yml

```
echo $(htpasswd -nb <username> <password>) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g
```
